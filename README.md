# Project Idea: Task Management Application with AWS, Angular, Spring Boot, Docker, Jenkins, and GitHub

## Overview:
Create a web-based task management application that allows users to create, manage, and track tasks. The application will consist of a front-end built with Angular, a back-end powered by Spring Boot, and the entire system will be deployed using Docker containers. Jenkins will be used for automating CI/CD processes, and GitHub will serve as the version control repository.

### Features:

- **User Registration and Authentication:**
  Users can register and log in to the application.
  Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Task Management:**
  Users can create, edit, update, and delete tasks.
  Tasks can have a title, description, due date, status, and priority.
- **Task Filtering and Sorting:**
  Users can filter and sort tasks based on various criteria like status, priority, due date, etc.
- **User Dashboard:**
  Display a dashboard with a summary of tasks, such as tasks due soon, completed tasks, etc.
- **Notifications:**
  Send email notifications for upcoming due dates or task assignments.
- **AWS Integration:**
  Use Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) to host the application's database.
  Utilize Amazon S3 for storing task-related attachments or files.
  Implement Amazon SES (Simple Email Service) for sending email notifications.
- **Front-end (Angular):**
  Create an Angular-based front-end for the application.
  Implement responsive design for various screen sizes.
- **Back-end (Spring Boot):**
  Develop a RESTful API using Spring Boot for CRUD operations on tasks.
  Use Spring Security for user authentication and authorization.
- **Containerization (Docker):**
  Dockerize both the front-end and back-end applications.
  Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.
- **CI/CD (Jenkins):**
  Set up a Jenkins pipeline for automating the CI/CD process.
  Configure Jenkins to build, test, and deploy the application to different environments (e.g., development, production) using Docker containers.
- **Version Control (GitHub):**
  Create a GitHub repository to host the project's source code.
  Utilize branching strategies (e.g., feature branches, main/master) for collaborative development.
## Benefits:

Learn to build a full-stack web application using modern technologies.
Gain experience with cloud services (AWS), front-end (Angular), and back-end (Spring Boot) development.
Understand the concepts of containerization and how Docker simplifies deployment.
Learn to automate development workflows using Jenkins for CI/CD.
Practice collaborative development using version control (GitHub).
This project idea covers a wide range of technologies and concepts, allowing you to learn and apply various skills relevant to modern software development practices. Keep in mind that this is a complex project, so you can adjust the scope and features based on your familiarity with the technologies and the time available.
